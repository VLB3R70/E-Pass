# E-Pass

**E-Pass** is a simple password manger which uses a local [SQLite3](https://sqlite.org/index.html) database to store the passwords. The project
is developed purely in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the documentation is built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

This project offers three types of applications: a TUI ~*Terminal User Interface*~, a GUI ~*Graphical User Interface*~
and an API REST developed with the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) framework.

The user can decide which of these packages can use. The three packages uses the same database which is stored 
locally.
