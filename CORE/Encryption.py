.. moduleauthor:: Alberto Jim√©nez <https://github.com/VLB3R70>

This module uses the `cryptography <https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/>`_ package for the encryption. There are two
main methods :py:func:`encrypt` and :py:func:`decrypt`. These methods are the ones which encrypts and decrypts the
passwords from the database.
